<h1>Happy Birthday My Angel</h1>
<div class="subtitle">06/02 — This day is so special, because it's your day.</div>

<div class="section">
<p>
I wish I could be with you today, close, in your arms. I wish I could show up in ways that don’t require screens or words.
But since I can’t, I built this instead. I did my best to keep it hidden and I know it can be disappointing considering the fact your christmas gift was a website too, but I didn't know what to give you, so I made something that stays when the moment passes.
</p>

<div class="quote">
“Remember, you're loved and you always will be.”
<span class="song">— Linkin Park, <em>"The Messenger"</em></span>
</div>

<p>
I choose you, you and only you over anyone. Forever, I want you to be mine and always be close in my heart. I love you, even through the rough times, and i'm never ever giving up on you, and us. Liam needs 𝓾𝓼, as you said.
</p>

<!-- FILL IN: Add a personal sentence about what this birthday means to you -->
<p><em>I know that you're scared for alot of stuff and overthink alot, but you always know i'm here and i'm not leaving anytime soon. I said that i'd do anything for you to have a good birthday and i still count on it. You deserve to feel loved and happy every single second of the week, and i'll always do my best to make sure of it. </em></p>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>My husband</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
I see how much you carry without saying anything.
I see the effort you put into surviving days that don’t feel fair.
You’re stronger than you think, and i'm so proud of you.
</p>

<div class="quote">
“if you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now.”
<span class="song">— Linkin Park, <em>"Invisible"</em></span>
</div>

<!-- FILL IN: Describe him in your own words -->
<p><em>As the song says, I want you to know that there won't be any day where you feel alone again. I'm always here to keep you upright. Your smile is the shiniest star i've ever seen, and I won't let it fade.</em></p>

<div class="quote">
“When life leaves us blind, love keeps us kind.”
<span class="song">— Linkin Park, <em>"The Messenger"</em></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>Your own playlist</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
I made you a playlist for your birthday.
I know it's not much, but I wanted you to actually hear everything you need. In this playlist, you'll find memories, love songs, songs to help you remind yourself how important you are to me.
When silence feels to heavy, as much as when you feel hyper, this playlist supports you as much as I do. 
</p>

<!-- FILL IN: Explain why music matters to you both -->
<p><em>I will tell you a few songs, and you will discover most of them. You can save the playlist, keep it close, and maybe new songs will appear overtime, who knows? I know how important music is to both of us, so I thought, why not make you a new playlist? All from your wife.I hope it will help and that you'll like it.</em></p>
<p>"𝐒𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬" - 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐰𝐧 𝐌𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐬 : The first song we "sung" together, eyes to eyes, while playing. That's where I really realised how lucky I am to have you close to me.</p>
<p>"𝐁𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭" - 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐞𝐰𝐢𝐬 : To remind yourself, that everything will be alright. (just don't let me go though)</p>
<p>"𝐆𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐚 𝐛𝐞 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧" - 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐜 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐣𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧 : One of my new favorite songs, one of the quotes is "gotta be a reason that I'm here on earth", well, you are my reason.</p>
<p>"𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬" - 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐤 : Just because you seemed attached to it, soo, have it baby.</p>
<p><em>I'm not spoiling further, have fun discovering it angel.</em></p>
